## Introduction

### What are we going to learn

*description*

### What is ReactJs

- **React** (also called **React.js** or **ReactJS**) is a free **JavaScript** library developed by Facebook since 2013. The main purpose of this library is to facilitate the creation of single-page web applications, through the creation of state-dependent components and generating an **HTML** page (or portion) at each state change.

- **React** is a library that only manages the interface of the application, considered the view in the **MVC model**. It can thus be used with another library or an MVC framework such as **AngularJS**. The library stands out from its competitors with its flexibility and performance, working with a virtual DOM and updating the rendering in the browser only when necessary.

### Why use ReactJs

**React** is an excellent tool with which to create interactive applications for mobile, web, and other platforms. React's popularity and usage are increasing day by day for good reason. As a developer, coding in React makes you better at **JavaScript**, a language that holds nearly 90% of the web development share today!
